            <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Web apps are more dynamic than ever â€” but with that comes growing exposure to security threats like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. One of the most effective tools in your frontend security toolkit is Content Security Policy (CSP).
              Content Security Policy (CSP) is a browser security feature that helps prevent malicious content from being executed on your website. It acts as a gatekeeper, telling the browser which sources are allowed to load content such as scripts, styles, images, fonts, and more.

              Instead of relying solely on escaping input and sanitizing output, CSP adds a powerful defense-in-depth layer.
